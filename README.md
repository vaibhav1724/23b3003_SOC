## Overview
 The **General AlphaZero** project aims to create a sophisticated, self-improving game-playing AI inspired by the groundbreaking research from Google DeepMind, titled ["Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815). This project teaches an AI to play games autonomously, improving its skills through continuous self-play and learning. The core technology is a modified version of the **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** algorithm, which allows the AI to explore various game scenarios and learn from them. The AI refines its strategies using **Reinforcement Learning** and is powered by **Residual Networks** (ResNets) as the backbone of its neural network architecture.
